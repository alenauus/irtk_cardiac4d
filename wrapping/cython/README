This is a Python interface to IRTK using Cython.

*** Prerequisites: ***

You will need the following Python module, which can be automatically installed from PyPI:
cython

mkdir ~/Python

In your .cshrc, add the following line:
setenv PYTHONPATH ~/Python

or the this one if you already have a PYTHONPATH defined
setenv PYTHONPATH ~/Python:$PYTHONPATH

Then:
easy_install --install-dir ~/Python cython

*** Basic installation: ***
Check out a fresh version of IRTK from SVN:
      svn co svn+ssh://shell4.doc.ic.ac.uk/vol/vipdata/vipsvn/SVN/irtk
or
        svn co file:///vol/vipdata/vipsvn/SVN/irtk

Then:
        cd irtk
        mkdir build
        cd build
        cmake -D WRAP_CYTHON=ON ..
        make -j 3 VERBOSE=1
        cd ../wrapping/cython
        make

Now you need to update your PYTHONPATH:
get the full path of full_path/irtk/build/lib
for bash, add to your ~/.bashrc
    export PYTHONPATH=full_path/irtk/build/lib:$PYTHONPATH
for tcsh, add to your ~/.cshrc
    setenv PYTHONPATH full_path/irtk/build/lib:$PYTHONPATH

You are now ready to go!

If you do not have OpenCV or VTK installed, the library will still be usable,
but some functionalities will be missing.



*** Advanced installation: ***

If you compiled IRTK with TBB or VTK, you will need to
create a file local.py in irtk/wrapping/cython

This file should not be checked into SVN as it is installation specific.
It should contain the following code (update the values to your system):

##########

__all__ = [ "has_vtk","has_tbb",
            "VTK_libdir","VTK_include_dir",
            "TBB_libdir", "TBB_include_dir",
            "extra_link_args" ]

has_vtk = True
has_tbb = True

VTK_libdir = "/vol/vipdata/users/kpk09/LOCAL/lib/vtk-5.8"
VTK_include_dir = "/vol/vipdata/users/kpk09/LOCAL/include/vtk-5.8"
TBB_libdir = "/vol/vipdata/users/kpk09/LOCAL/lib"
TBB_include_dir = "/vol/vipdata/users/kpk09/LOCAL/include"

# useful for debugging compilation/linking issues
import sys
python_version = sys.version[:3]
extra_link_args = [ "-lpython"+python_version,
                    "-Wl,-no-undefined" ]

##########


*** Notes: ***

You can get:
 - OpenCV from http://opencv.org/
 - TBB from http://threadingbuildingblocks.org/
 - VTK from http://www.vtk.org/

Python tips:
 - Installing Python packages: "easy_install" or "pip install"
 - Having your own Python installation: http://www.virtualenv.org/
 - Interactive Python: ipython, ipython notebook, ipython qtconsole
 - Machine Learning: http://scikit-learn.org/
 - Plotting: http://matplotlib.org/
 - Parallel code: http://pythonhosted.org/joblib/

And never forget: Python will do fast what he is meant to do fast.
For the rest, you have C++ easily accessible through Cython (http://www.cython.org/).
